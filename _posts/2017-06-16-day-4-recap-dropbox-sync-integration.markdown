Today, was a productive day. I was able to setup CI on the awesome circleci.com website.
I wrote a few tests for the sync code which would interact with Dropbox. A very important
lesson that I learnt early on is: Keep your critical piece of code well tested.
Also, it gives me great confidence to jump in and change things when I know that I have a good
set of tests backing me.

Writing code is always the easy part. I plan on spending some time trying to interact with potential
customers to get a sense of the features they'd like to see in the app. This is always the difficult part.
Hopefully, I'll be able to make some head way today. I'll write up about the feedback I receive too.

That's it for today. Not much in the form of updates. However, good progress has been made!

Onward!
