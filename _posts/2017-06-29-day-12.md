Well, today wasn't a good day! [At least yesterday I built a feature and tore it down](http://blog.12startupsin12months.in/2017/06/27/day-11-sunk-costs-and-complexity/) and learnt a few lessons.

Sprymesh is fully functional and is 90% complete. However, the remaining 90% work still needs to be done. And it is very hard to maintain focus and motivation.

I am a huge fan of [Better Call Saul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Better_Call_Saul_episodes#Season_3_.282017.29) and have been putting off watching the finale for quite some time. I have been having a blast building sprymesh and blogging about it. However, today wasn't one of those days. Today, I dragged my feet through the day without making any real progress. And spent the last part of the day watching the finale. Well at least that part is wrapped up.

I always tell myself that the difference between a professional and an amateur is that the professional does the work even when doesn't feel like doing it. Whereas the amateur does it only when he feels like doing it. I don't want to be an amateur. However, it is tough. Anyway, I hope to find better ways to get back on the horse on days like these.

Maybe I should build a simple throw away fun project on days like these? How do *you* deal with days when you don't feel like working? I'd love to hear your thoughts. Also, I'd love to hear your comments and feedback on sprymesh. Everybody needs motivation.
