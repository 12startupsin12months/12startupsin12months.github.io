Good News Everyone!

![Good News Everyone](/assets/good-news-everyone.jpg)

I am releasing sprymesh into public beta today! Go ahead and try it out at https://sprymesh.com !

Polishing something takes forever. However, I put a few hard stops for myself so that I wouldn't get too carried away.
I'd love to get your feedback on how the app works.

  1. Do you see the app to be useful as it is?
  2. What are the features/changes that will add value to the app?
  3. How much would you be willing to pay monthly for a service like this? $5? $10?

Thanks a lot guys!
