It has been a bit quiet for the past few days.
I haven't been able to make much progress in the code base. My objective for the first version
of sprymesh has been to be able to host sprymesh's blog and documentation on itself.
This way I would be able to [dogfood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) the product.

I am stuck trying to get a feature shipped which allows me to mention which sub directory to consider as the root
for the website. Once, I have this feature I can build my blogs/documentation using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) and [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/).
I had to do some refactoring which in turn led me to write some much needed unit tests to cover the code which handled the syncing.
All in all, I hope this will help me features more quickly in the future.

Getting stuck in the mud for a few days can drain your motivation :(
I have found this quote to be very appropriate:

> People often say that motivation doesn't last. Well, neither does bathing - that's why we recommend it daily. &mdash; Zig Ziglar

I have been listening to some great podcasts and have been reading [The hard thing about hard things](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18176747-the-hard-thing-about-hard-things).
It has been a great help in keeping me motivated.

Have you ever had trouble keeping yourself motivated? How were you able to get yourself pumped up? I'd love to hear your stories!
