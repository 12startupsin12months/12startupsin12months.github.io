I am on a journey to build 12 startups in 12 months. And, I want to share my lessons with you :)

The first startup that I am building is called [sprymesh.com](https://sprymesh.com). It is a simple web host which uses Dropbox to sync your files.
I am building it using Elixir, Phoenix and Postgresql. I'll be blogging about my daily struggles on this blog. Follow along!
